# 🧪 Playground — Mini Web Projects Hub

Welcome to my **Playground** 👋  
This repository is a growing collection of **mini web projects**, experiments, and practice builds created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Each project lives in its **own folder** and is **live-hosted via GitHub Pages**.  
Think of this repo as a **central hub** for all my frontend experiments 🚀
